Repro for this issue: https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/issues/1506

Verified on macOS 10.15.5

**Update**
Doing a fresh clone on the same machine didn't reproduce this behaviour. Which suggests that it's something to do with my IDE, or the way I installed the dependencies/created the files that is causing this. 

## Instructions


```
npm i
npm test

```

expected behaviour: 

The tests pass. 

Actual behaviour: 

```
